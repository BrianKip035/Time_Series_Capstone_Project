    "The main objective of this project is to develop accurate time series models that can forecast economic indicators and commodity prices. Economic indicators such as inflation, exchange rates, and GDP growth are critical factors for businesses, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions about pricing, investment, and monetary policy. Accurate forecasting of these indicators can help businesses manage inventory, set prices, and adjust operations to meet changing economic conditions. Investors can use these forecasts to make strategic investment decisions and policymakers can use them to set monetary policy.\n",

    "The project focuses on providing value to businesses, investors, and policymakers who require accurate and timely economic forecasts. The real-world problem that this project aims to solve is the challenge of accurately forecasting economic indicators and commodity prices. The stakeholders who could benefit from this project include businesses, investors, and policymakers who need to make informed decisions based on economic data.\n",

    "## Data Sources:\n",
    "The data for Inflation Rates.csv, Annual GDP.csv, and Exchange Rates.csv are obtained from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)  [here](https://www.centralbank.go.ke/inflation-rates/) website. CBK is the central monetary authority of Kenya responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy in the country. The data for commodity prices.xlsx is obtained from the Food Security Portal [here](https://fews.net/kenya-monthly-fews-net-staple-food-price-data-0) which is maintained by the International Food Policy Research Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the Data:\n",
    "Inflation Rates.csv contains the monthly inflation rates from January 2000 to December 2022. The data is presented as percentages, and the inflation rates are calculated as year-on-year changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Kenyan economy. The dataset contains 276 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual GDP.csv contains the annual GDP of Kenya in current prices (Kenyan Shillings) from 1960 to 2021. The GDP is calculated as the value of goods and services produced within the country's borders, and it is presented in nominal terms. The dataset contains 62 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange Rates.csv contains the daily exchange rates of major currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, and JPY) against the Kenyan Shilling from January 2000 to December 2022. The exchange rates are presented as the number of units of foreign currency that can be exchanged for one Kenyan Shilling. The dataset contains 6,346 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commodity prices.xlsx contains monthly prices of selected food commodities (maize, beans, rice, and wheat) in Kenya from January 2005 to December 2022. The data is presented in Kenyan Shillings per kilogram, and the dataset contains 216 observations for each commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability of the Data:\n",
    "The data from CBK and the Food Security Portal is highly relevant to the Kenyan economy and is suitable for the project. Inflation Rates.csv provides insight into the inflation trends in Kenya, which is essential for forecasting commodity prices. Annual GDP.csv helps in understanding the overall performance of the Kenyan economy, and Exchange Rates.csv is crucial in forecasting the future prices of commodities denominated in foreign currencies. Commodity prices.xlsx is essential for understanding the trends and patterns of food commodity prices in Kenya, which is essential for predicting food security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitations:\n",
    "The data from CBK and the Food Security Portal is comprehensive, but there are some limitations. Inflation Rates.csv only covers the period from January 2000 to December 2022, which may not capture long-term trends in inflation. Annual GDP.csv only presents the GDP in nominal terms, which does not account for changes in the prices of goods and services over time. Exchange Rates.csv only covers a limited number of major currencies, which may not reflect the exchange rates of other currencies that may affect commodity prices. Commodity prices.xlsx only covers a limited number of food commodities, which may not reflect the prices of other essential commodities affecting food security in Kenya."

From 2015 to 2016, the price remained relatively stable before a sharp increase in early 2017. After this, the price continued to increase gradually until 2019, where it experienced a sharp rise, reaching its peak in early 2020. However, since then, the price of bread has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations.\n",

    "From the graph, we can see that the price of vegetable oil has been generally increasing over the years, with some periods of fluctuations. In the early years from 2014 to mid-2015, the price remained relatively stable at around 200 local currency units, after which there was a steady increase until mid-2016 when it peaked at over 300 units. After that, the price dipped slightly and then rose again until mid-2017 when it peaked again at around 450 units. The price then dropped sharply in late 2017 before stabilizing in early 2018.\n",

Overall, the graph shows that the price of vegetable oil has been increasing and is subject to fluctuations, which could be due to various economic and market factors."

    "The graph shows the trend in diesel prices over the years. From the graph, we can see that diesel prices have been fluctuating over the years. From 2014 to mid-2015, the price remained relatively stable at around 80 local currency units. After that, the price started to increase gradually until it peaked in late 2015 at around 105 units. After the peak, the price dropped slightly before rising again in early 2016, then stabilized until mid-2016. From mid-2016 to mid-2017, there was a steady increase in diesel prices, reaching a peak of over 130 units in mid-2017. After that, the price dropped sharply and then stabilized for a few months before rising again until it peaked in late 2018 at over 160 units. Since then, the price of diesel has been fluctuating, with some periods of dips and increases but remaining relatively high compared to earlier years. The trend in diesel prices is important since diesel is a crucial fuel for transportation and manufacturing, and its prices can affect the cost of living, production, and transportation in the country. Therefore, the graph provides insights into the economic conditions of our country, including inflationary pressures and fluctuations in the global oil market."

Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and a high inflation rate indicates a decrease in the purchasing power of a country's currency. From the graph, we can see that the  inflation rate has been subject to fluctuations over the years. In the early years from 2014 to 2016, the inflation rate was relatively stable at around 6-8%, after which there was a gradual increase until 2017, where it peaked at around 11%.

The different commodities include Bread (400g), Vegetable Oil (1L), Milk (500ML), Diesel (1L), Maize meal (2kg), and Gasoline (1L).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the graph, we can see that the prices of most commodities increased steadily over time, with some experiencing more drastic price changes than others. For example, the price of Maize meal (2kg) increased dramatically from around mid-2016 to mid-2017, after which it stabilized for a while before increasing again towards the end of 2019. The price of Diesel (1L) also experienced a significant increase from mid-2017 to mid-2018 before stabilizing and then slightly decreasing towards the end of 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the price of Bread (400g) increased gradually over time with some fluctuations, while the price of Milk (500ML) remained relatively stable over the years. The price of Vegetable Oil (1L) and Gasoline (1L) also experienced some fluctuations over time, but their overall trend was upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that the exchange rate (USD) had a generally upward trend over the years, which suggests a depreciation of the local currency relative to the USD. This is particularly evident in the later years, where the exchange rate increased dramatically.\n",

    "Overall, this graph gives a good visual representation of the price trends of different commodities and the exchange rate over time, highlighting the changes and fluctuations that have occurred in the market. It could be useful for identifying patterns and making informed decisions regarding investment and trade in the local market."
